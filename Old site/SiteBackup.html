            <p class="left">
              Hello, welcome to the site that's all about me, myself, and I.
              I'm currently a third year computer science student at the University of Guelph. 
              If I had to describe myself with one word I would use curious. I'm always interested
              in learning new things. If I come upon a new fact or something that I haven't heard of 
              I have an indescribable urge to explore and dive in to the unknown. I also apply
              myself in the same way, any task that I don't currently have the knowledge to accomplish,
              is just another opportunity for me to learn something new!
            </p>

            <h2 class="right">Improvment goals</h2>
            <p class="right">
              During my position as a junior technician at Synergenics, I created goals that coincided with the requirements of my position. I targeted an area where I saw a need and created goals that would help improve the company and my performance as a valued employee. 
              <br><br>
              I focused on communication and problem solving skills while also giving myself an opportunity to put my creativity to work. By developing both problem solving and communication skills, I am better prepared to face workplace challenges and can apply these skills to a broad range of situations.

            <h2 class="right">Position Overview</h2>
            <p class="right">
              I was involved with the installation and maintenance of customer IT systems and infrastructure. This consisted of supporting clients in many different areas such as remote support for software issues; taking clients physical systems in for repair and maintenance; going onsite to diagnose network issues. The most unique aspect of my position was being a main cog in the “machine” of Synergenics, with other coworkers relying on you to complete your work before they can do theirs made for an interesting and fast moving work environment. 
              <br><br>
              The skills I needed for the job were already built up from my previous experience in IT. Mainly rooted in hardware, operating systems(Mac & Windows), networking, and programming. What I gained were layers of new information, that built up my foundation of knowledge. This process greatly expanded my perspective of the IT world, by showing me all the areas that I thought I understood and blowing them out of the water with piles of new information.
            </p>
            <h2 class="right">New Technological Experience</h2>
            <p class="right">
              I was able to work with a wide variety of technology, many of which I haven’t had the opportunity to work with yet. 
              <br>
              Networking equipment - I didn’t have a great understanding on how computer networks truly functioned. Working directly with clients broadened my perspective, and gave me the chance to work hands on with networking gear such as 
              <br>
                - Cabling(ethernet) new buildings<br>
                - Network switches and routers<br>
                - VPN remote access<br>
              Full stack development - I wanted to learn more about the process of developing a full scale project. Computer hardware - I’ve always been very interested in the hardware component of computers and technology, but due to high costs haven’t had many chances to work on anything(besides my own computer).

            <h2 class="right">Development of Goals after 8 months</h2>
            <p class="right">
              I completed nearly all of the goals I had set for myself during this work term. Half of the goals I set for myself were related to improving my communication skills in the workplace. Whether it be giving bad news to clients, or effectively communicating issues I was facing to my co-workers, I garnered a lot of experience communicating in the tech world. 
              <br><br>
               I wanted to increase the initiative I took in solving new problems that I was faced with. For example, near the beginning of my term I would have to go to my co-workers for nearly every problem, as I was lacking the sufficient knowledge to solve them. Later in my term with the increased knowledge I had gained, I wanted to push myself to try and always attempt a job before going to a coworker. This led to me solving problems at a much faster rate.
