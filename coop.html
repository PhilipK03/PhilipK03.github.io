                  During my position as a junior technician at Synergenics, I created goals that coincided with the requirements of my position. I targeted an area where I saw a need and created goals that would help improve the company and my performance as a valued employee. <br />
                  I focused on communication and problem solving skills while also giving myself an opportunity to put my creativity to work. By developing both problem solving and communication skills, I am better prepared to face workplace challenges and can apply these skills to a broad range of situations.

            I was involved with the installation and maintenance of customer IT systems and infrastructure. This consisted of supporting clients in many different areas such as remote support for software issues; taking clients physical systems in for repair and maintenance; going onsite to diagnose network issues. The most unique aspect of my position was being a main cog in the “machine” of Synergenics, with other coworkers relying on you to complete your work before they can do theirs made for an interesting and fast moving work environment.
            <br />
            The skills I needed for the job were already built up from my previous experience in IT. Mainly rooted in hardware, operating systems(Mac & Windows), networking, and programming. What I gained were layers of new information, that built up my foundation of knowledge. This process greatly expanded my perspective of the IT world, by showing me all the areas that I thought I understood and blowing them out of the water with piles of new information.
