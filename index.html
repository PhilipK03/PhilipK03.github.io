                Hello, welcome to the site that's all about me, myself, and I.
                I'm currently a third year computer science student at the University of Guelph. 
                If I had to describe myself with one word I would use curious. I'm always interested
                in learning new things. If I come upon a new fact or something that I haven't heard of 
                I have an indescribable urge to explore and dive in to the unknown. I also apply
                myself in the same way, any task that I don't currently have the knowledge to accomplish,
                is just another opportunity for me to learn something new!
              </p>
