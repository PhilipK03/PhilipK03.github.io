            <p class="left">
              Hello, welcome to the site that's all about me, myself, and I.
              I'm currently a third year computer science student at the University of Guelph. 
              If I had to describe myself with one word I would use curious. I'm always interested
              in learning new things. If I come upon a new fact or something that I haven't heard of 
              I have an indescribable urge to explore and dive in to the unknown. I also apply
              myself in the same way, any task that I don't currently have the knowledge to accomplish,
              is just another opportunity for me to learn something new!
            </p>

              During my position as a junior technician at Synergenics I created
              goals that conicided with what my position required of me. I tried to target an 
              area of where I thought I lacking and create goals that would help improve myself as an employee.

            <p class="right">
              I decided to focus on communication and problem solving skills while also giving myself 
              an opportunity to put my creativity to work. By progressing both problem 
              solving and communication skills I figure regardless of what situation I find myself
              in I'll be better prepared to take it head on.

            <h2 class="right">Position Overview</h2>
            <p class="right">
              I was involved with the installation and maintenance of customer IT 
              systems and infrastructure. This consisted of supporting clients in 
              many different areas such as remote support for software issues; taking 
              clients physical systems in for repair and maintenance; going onsite 
              to diagnose network issues. The most unique aspect of my position was 
              being a main cog in the “machine” of Synergenics, with other coworkers 
              relying on you to complete your work before they can do theirs made for 
              an interesting and fast moving work environment. <br>
              The skills I needed for the job were already built up from my previous 
              experience in IT. Mainly rooted in hardware, operating systems(Mac & Windows), 
              networking, and programming. What I gained were layers of new information, 
              that built up my foundation of knowledge. This process greatly expanded my 
              perspective of the IT world, by showing me all the areas that I thought I 
              understood and blowing them out of the water with piles of new information.
