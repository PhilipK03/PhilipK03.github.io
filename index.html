               Hello, welcome to the site that'a all about me, myself, and I.
               I'm currently a third year computer science student at the University of Guelph. 
               If I had to describe myself with one word I would use curious. I'm alwyas interested
               in learning new things. If I come upon a new fact or something that I haven't heard of 
               I have an undescribable urge to explore and dive in to the unknown. I also apply
               mylef in the same way, any task that I don't currently have the knowledge to accomplish,
               is just another opportunity for me to learn something new!
